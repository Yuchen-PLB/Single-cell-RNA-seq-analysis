# Single-cell-RNA-seq-analysis
## Introduction

Human cells, despite sharing identical genetic material, display diverse gene expression profiles that define their identity, state, and function. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level, allowing for high-resolution analysis across millions of cells in a single study \cite{Tang2009}. scRNA-seq has transformed our understanding of cellular diversity and enabled identification of rare, functionally important cell populations \cite{Hooke1665, Leeuwenhoek1674}.
